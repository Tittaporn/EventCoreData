# EventCoreData
### Week3 Assessment at DevMountain

In this assessment, I built an event management application. The application should allow users to create events, delete events, and allow users to mark if you are planning to attend the event or not. The event will utilize Core Data.

## Note the following requirements:

 * The initial screen shows a list of events. Each row shows the event title and a symbol demonstrating a plan to attend or not attend.
 * There will be a button that will navigate the user to an empty detail view, allowing the user to add an event to the list of events.
 * Tapping on the attending button will toggle the events attending state.
 * Tapping on a cell will navigate the user to a detail view, where they can see the events details, modify the events details, and re-save the event.
 * Quitting the app and re-launching it will accurately show your events and attending state (core data persistence).
Feel free to use any extra time to challenge yourself with the black diamonds and make your app look good.

## Black Diamonds
 * Add local notifications to display when the app is closed or in background mode. The notification should let a user know which event is starting.
 * Implement sectioning to events attending and events not attending in separate sections.
 * Add the ability for your app to receive banner & sound notifications while the app is in the foreground.

## Covered Concepts
This assessment is intended to assess  ability to build applications that make use of  CoreData and the Protocol-Delegate communication pattern to display and manipulate a collection of data. It covers the following concepts taught in Week 3:
 * The MVC design pattern
 * CoreData, including (Models, NSMangaedObjectContext, FetchRequest, and CoreData persistence)
 * The role and use of the Protocol-Delegate communication pattern
